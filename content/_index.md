LieDB is a collaboratively edited database of the lies politicians
tell and the fact checking that catches them.

We don't currently do any fact checking ourselves, instead linking to
analysis from [trusted fact checkers](/checker).  While most fact
checkers will publish an article then mostly forget about it, LieDB is
focused on creating rich, evolving pages which are updated to reflect
new information as it becomes available.

Most fact-checking sites will publish an article then largely forget
about it.  If a politician makes the same claim again, or a different
politician repeats the claim, they may or may not publish a new
article.

LieDB, on the other hand, is designed to evolve as new information
becomes available.  When a claim is repeated (by anyone), that
information is added to the database, and there are bi-directional
links between the false claims and those who make them.

More than just being a good reference, the data behind LieDB is freely
available in machine-readable formats, meaning anyone can download the
data and make something new.

## Want to Help?

If you're interested in helping improve LieDB (there is a *lot* to
do!), head over to the [GitHub
project](https://github.com/liedb/liedb).

We need objective people to find false claims, sources, and relevant
fact-checking articles.  This may be difficult to believe, but it
turns out politicians lie quite a bit, and there is a lot of data to
go through.  If you don't know how to add the data yourself you can
just file an issue with the relevant information and we'll add it as
soon as possible.

On the technical side of things, as you can probably tell by looking
at the site, we could really use a good designer, and maybe a good
front-end developer to work with them.  A data visualization expert
could also find plenty of opportunities as well.
