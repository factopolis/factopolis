LieDB is a non-partisan site to track when politicians lie.  We
don't do any fact-checking ourselves, but instead provide links to
trusted third-parties who have verified claims to be false.

While anyone is free to submit new material, but this site is **not**
a wiki.  Contributions are checked before they are posted, and all
sources must be credible.

Political party doesn't matter, and there are no geographical or
notability restrictions.  The only restriction is that the person must
be political figure.  Examples of political figures include:

 * Politicians
 * Political staffers in public-facing roles such as press secretaries
 * Pundits & talking heads
