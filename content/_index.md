title: About Factopolis
---

You may have noticed that politicans lie sometimes. Okay, more than
sometimesâ€¦ Factopolis is a non-partisan attempt to hold them
accountable by providing a continuously updated source of data about
those lies. The data is presented on our web site, but it is also
freely available to others to power alternate interfaces.

Most fact checking sites provide fact checks as a "wall of text";
articles which go into great detail about a claim and why it is either
accurate or inaccurate. Factopolis takes a different tack by
providing the information in a more structured format, and linking to
other sites for details.

Another important aspect of Factopolis is that the data is living; new
information is added as it becomes available. This contrasts with most
fact checking sites, which will write an article about a specific
instance of a claim being made, then leave the article unaltered from
that point on. Sometimes, if a politician repeats the claim, they'll
write a new article (and maybe link to the old one), but that's
it.

Not only does Factopolis evolve to include similar statements by the
same person, it also includes instances of other people making the
same claim, including surrogates and pundits.

Factopolis accomplishes this by separating the core claim from
individual statements and listing all instances of that claim we can
find, even if fact checkers haven't looked at a specific statement. Our
hope is that this will make Factopolis less tolerant of
[weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) and vaugery.

Factopolis is collaboratively edited; if you notice we're missing a
claim, a fact check, or got something wrong, you can help fix it! As
long as you provide reliable sources, we're happy to accept any new
data. If you think our data is too focused on [Donald
Trump](/person/donald-trump), feel free to add information on [Barack
Obama](/person/barack-obama), or *vice versa*. There are plenty of
lies to go around!
