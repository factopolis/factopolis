Factopolis is open-source, and you can access all of our data from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis).

While the markdown data is convenient for editing, it's not very convenient for acessing programatically, which is why we also provide HTTP-accessible JSON files which are build from the markdown.

 * [person/index.json](person/index.json) â€” Provides a list of all
   people in the database, plus some additional data about each person.

We're in the process of adding more JSON data to support our client-side front-end, but if you don't want to wait feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues) about making the data you need available.

If you want a copy of the entire database, you can use [/index.json](/index.json) (*warning: large file*). Please download this file sparingly to be nice to our web host.
