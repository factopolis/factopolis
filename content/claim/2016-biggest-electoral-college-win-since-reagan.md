    shortQuote: Except, it wasn’t.
    quote:
      In 2016, Trump won 306 Electoral College votes, 36 votes over
      the 270 needed to win. (He ended up getting only 304, because of
      two faithless electors.) Given Trump’s loosely organized
      campaign and controversial statements, the businessman’s win was
      definitely a surprise—the majority of pundits, pollsters, and
      politicos predicted he would lose.

      But it wasn’t the biggest win since Reagan who won 90.9% of the
      electoral college votes in 1980, according to data by the New
      York Times. The Times ranks Trump's electoral win as the 46th
      biggest of 58 elections.

      Trump's wasn’t even the biggest win since Barack Obama. In 2012,
      Obama received 332 electoral votes. And in 2008, Obama won
      365. Both times, Obama managed to win over 60% of the electoral
      college votes. Obama came close to besting President Bill
      Clinton, who won 70.4% of the Electoral College votes in 1996.

      It was, however, a more substantial win than the last Republican
      president, President George W. Bush, who just barely received
      over 50% of the Electoral College vote in both of his
      elections. In 2000, Bush won 271 Electoral Votes and in 2004, he
      was reelected with 286 votes. But Trump’s was not a bigger win
      than fellow Republican President George H.W. Bush, who earned
      79.2% of the electoral vote in 1988. At the time Bush 41 did, in
      fact, have the biggest win since Reagan.
