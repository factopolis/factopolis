      In fact, voting experts we talked to pointed to numerous studies
      that have found such in-person voter fraud — the type of fraud
      Trump is alleging — is virtually nonexistent. A Government
      Accountability Office report released in October 2014 said that
      “no apparent cases of in-person voter impersonation [were]
      charged by DOJ’s Criminal Division or by U.S. Attorney’s offices
      anywhere in the United States from 2004 through July 3, 2014.”
