    quote:
      The company began to collect sales taxes in 2012 in California,
      where it began to build warehouses, as well as in Texas,
      Pennsylvania and other states, The Times reported. By the end of
      2016, Amazon’s tax collection had expanded to 29 states,
      according to Mr. Davis.

      And as of this April, Amazon has collected sales taxes in all
      states that have one. (Five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana,
      New Hampshire and Oregon — do not.) Amazon does not, however,
      require third-party sellers on its marketplace to collect sales
      taxes, but offers the service to them.
