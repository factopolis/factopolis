title: Clinton Gave 20% of America's Uranium to Russia
summary:
  The State Department was one of nine agencies which had to approve
  the deal, it's unlikely Clinton was personally involved, and there
  is no evidence of a payment to Clinton.

      There is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal
      personally, and it is highly questionable that this deal even
      rose to the level of the secretary of state. Theoretically, as
      Schweizer says, Clinton could have intervened. But even then, it
      ultimately would have been Obama’s decision whether to suspend
      or block the deal.

      We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios. Trump so often
      uses broad-brushed language that pushes him into Four Pinocchio
      territory, and this is yet another one of those cases. He
      specifically names Hillary Clinton as the active agent in the
      Uranium One deal, saying she “gave them” or “handed over”
      uranium to the Russians, but that is not the case. Then, he
      further claimed the sale went forward in exchange “for a big
      payment.” There’s no evidence for that claim either.
