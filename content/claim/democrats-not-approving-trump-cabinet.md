      Part of the blame may lie with the administration, which still
      hasn’t formally sent the paperwork to the Senate for the
      nomination of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue to lead the
      Agriculture Department.

      It’s hard to overstate what nonsense this is.

      It is true that, at one time, Senate Democrats were dragging
      their heels on Trump’s Cabinet picks. In January, members of the
      party boycotted committee votes to advance nominees to the full
      Senate, slowing the process. In recent weeks, however, the
      process has happened in regular bursts. Three Cabinet picks have
      been approved in the last two days.

      How does Trump compare to past presidents? At this moment, he
      has two unconfirmed Cabinet positions — the same as Barack Obama
      had on Mar. 3, 2009. In fact, only three of the last six
      presidents have had their entire Cabinets in place at this
      point.
