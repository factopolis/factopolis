    quote:
      Trump said that Pershing stopped "radical Islamic terror" for 35
      years. Of the eight historians we checked with the first time we
      heard Trump speak about Pershing, all were at least skeptical
      that the specific tales of Pershing actually took place, and some
      expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that.

      But more critically, the historians took issue with Trumpâ€™s
      suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all --
      actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for
      years.
