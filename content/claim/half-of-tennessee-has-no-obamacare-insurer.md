    quote:
      Tennessee divides the state into eight rating areas. Three of
      the eight — the East, Greater Nashville and Greater Memphis
      areas — have two carriers selling health insurance on the
      federal marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, according
      to the state’s 2017 rating area plans and rates. The other five
      rating areas have only one carrier.

      It is important that at least one company is selling insurance
      on the marketplace in each rating area, because the federal
      government provides tax credits and subsidies to help pay for
      insurance only for those who purchase plans on the exchanges set
      up by the Affordable Care Act.
