    short: There is no evidence to support that theory, and that’s not for a lack of attention.
    quote:
      There is no evidence to support that theory, and that’s not for a
      lack of attention. A federal appeals court has looked into it, as
      has the N.C. Board of Elections, and both found nothing of
      concern. Political scientists also disagree with Trump. And even
      if the study Trump was citing is valid – although many say it's
      not – it still doesn’t back up Trump's claim.
