      Trump portrayed Khan as an official with his head in the sand
      about the attacks that disrupted his city. The reality is the
      president plucked five words from the mayor’s longer message
      that condemned the terrorist acts and explained why Londoners
      would see an increased police presence in the coming days. Khan
      was not saying there is "no reason to be alarmed," period, by
      the attack -- he was pre-empting concerns about what law
      enforcement presence might mean in the days to come.

      Mayor Sadiq Khan was attempting to reassure the people of London
      that a greater police presence they might see in the aftermath
      of the previous day’s attack was a public safety precaution; he
      was not indicating that another attack was imminent or that
      citizens should “not be alarmed” by what had occurred.
