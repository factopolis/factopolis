    short:
      Rather, U.S. purchases of Mexican goods — to say nothing of
      services — are more than 10 times the size of remittances.
    quote:
      A projected $27 billion influx of cash from the United States
      into Mexico is nothing to sneeze at, and this money makes a real
      difference in the lives of many Mexicans who have relatives
      living and working in the United States, whether legally or
      illegally.


      However, contrary to what Conway said, remittances do not rank
      No. 1 on the U.S.-Mexico income flow list. Rather,
      U.S. purchases of Mexican goods — to say nothing of services —
      are more than 10 times the size of remittances. And remittances
      also trail foreign direct investment as a source of income in
      Mexico. We rate the statement False.
