      But we found at least
      [37 times](http://www.politifact.com/obama-like-health-care-keep/)
      since Obama’s inauguration where he or a top administration
      official made a variation of the pledge that if you like your
      plan, you can keep it, and we never found an instance in which he
      offered the caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t
      changed after the law’s passage. And seven of those 37 cases came
      after the release of the HHS regulations that defined the
      "grandfathering" process, when the impact would be clear.
