    quote:
      This refers to the number of people who were in transit when the
      ban was announced. It doesn’t account for people who tried to
      board flights to the United States (over 1,200) and were denied,
      for visas that were revoked (about 60,000 according to the State
      Department) or for refugees admitted (64,000 in the last two
      fiscal years).
