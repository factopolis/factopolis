    quote:
      Trump said that the Paris agreement allows China "to build
      hundreds of additional coal plants," while the United States
      can’t. The White House offered no legal argument to back that
      up, and the text of the agreement fails to support it. The Paris
      agreement never mentions the word coal, and in Trump’s own
      words, it is nonbinding.

    quote:
      This is false. The agreement is nonbinding and each nation sets
      its own targets. There is nothing in the agreement that stops
      the United States from building coal plants or gives the
      permission to China or India to build coal plants. In fact,
      market forces, primarily reduced costs for natural gas, have
      forced the closure of coal plants. China announced this year
      that it would cancel plans to build more than 100 coal-fired
      plants.
