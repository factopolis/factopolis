    quote:
      Trump appears to have forgotten that imprecise wording in the
      executive order led to confusion over whether U.S. permanent
      residents — green-card holders — were also banned from returning
      to the United States. The White House counsel later issued
      guidance making clear that they were not covered. The Court of
      Appeals later said that the counsel’s statement was not a
      sufficient fix.
