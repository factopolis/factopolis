    quote:
      It's not clear where Trump got this number. It's true that
      Cuban-Americans tend to be more conservative than other Latino
      voters. But at least in the state with by far the most
      Cuban-Americans, the Trump share of the vote wasn't nearly this
      high. According to the [Pew Research
      Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/15/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump/),
      just over half (54 percent) of Cuban-Americans in Florida — home
      to two-thirds of all Cuban-American eligible voters — voted for
      Trump.


      In fact, Cuban-American voters have grown less Republican over
      the years. [According to
      Pew](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/24/after-decades-of-gop-support-cubans-shifting-toward-the-democratic-party/),
      nearly two-thirds of Cuban-Americans were Republican or
      Republican-leaning as of 2002. As of 2013, it was just 47
      percent.


      NPR has reached out to the White House for a source on this
      figure but did not receive a response.
