      There is no evidence that we could find, however, that he spoke
      against the war *before* it started, although we did find he
      expressed early concerns about the cost and direction of the war
      a few months after it started.

    quote:
      We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq
      War before the invasion where he seemed apprehensive but not
      vehemently opposed to the operation. In another interview, Trump
      said he supported the invasion.
