title: Trump's Trip Saved Billions of Dollars and Millions of Jobs
summary:
  Trump is counting his chickens before they hatch. Even if he
  succeeds in reorienting U.S. trade policy, jobs gains are still
  likely to be illusionary.

      He's referencing an arms deal that's not enacted and other
      apparent deals that weren't announced on the trip.

      We can’t know for sure how many jobs will be created or saved --
      nor, despite the certainty of his language, does Trump -- but
      the evidence at this point is so thin and so premature as to be
      little more than puffery or wishful thinking. We rate the
      statement False.

    quote:
      But it’s one thing to announce such deals and another thing to
      actually follow through with them. At the time of the signing,
      such deal numbers are especially inflated, which is why the word
      “potentially” slips into the talking points. At least some of
      the Saudi investments predated Trump’s election, but apparently
      have now been repackaged as a deliverable on the president’s
      trip.


      As for the number of jobs, thousands appears to have morphed
      into millions. But an analysis published by The Washington Post
      reported that the U.S. companies involved would not confirm any
      specific number of jobs saved or supported, suggesting that
      Trump’s original estimate of “thousands” was more guesswork than
      reality. Our colleague Steven Mufson reported that the deals
      would create jobs — in Saudi Arabia. “Most of the deals unveiled
      Saturday were memorandums of understanding rather than solid
      contracts, and thus still require further negotiation,” he
      added.
