    short:
      Even in the most affordable states, most 21-year-olds pay much
      more than $12 a month simply for their premiums.
    quote:
      An average 21-year-old making $25,000 a year would be charged
      $282 per month for a silver Obamacare plan, according to the
      Kaiser Family Foundation. However, that person would qualify for
      federal subsidies that would cut the amount they would
      personally pay by half to $142. That person could also be
      responsible for a four-figure deductible, which is the amount
      each consumer must pay out-of-pocket before coverage kicks in.


      Even in the most affordable states, most 21-year-olds pay much
      more than $12 a month simply for their premiums. In Utah, one of
      the least expensive states in the nation for Obamacare coverage
      for young people, for example, an average 21-year-old would pay
      $142 a month, according to Kaiser. The cost without subsidies
      would be $198.


      In Alaska, one of the most expensive states, a 21-year-old would
      pay $104, but only because subsidies would cover most of the
      actual cost of $707 per month.
