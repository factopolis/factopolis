      The United States didn’t have a president-appointed,
      Senate-confirmed secretary of Treasury for 34 days in
      2013. Mnuchin’s confirmation could drag out longer, but Conway
      made this claim on Feb. 2, 14 days after inauguration.

When Kellyanne Conway made this claim (February 2) it had been 14
days, which is what this claim is judged by. However, Steve Mnuchin
was confirmed on February 13, which is still 10 days shy of the 34-day
period in 2013, and 11 shy of the 35-day period in 2002-2003.
