    quote:
      Trump did sign an order that he said would result in a lifetime
      ban on administration officials lobbying for foreign
      governments. But his five-year ban on lobbying is less than
      advertised. Trump has originally promised to extend the ban to
      congressional officials, but he did not. Moreover, the five-year
      ban applies only to lobbying one’s former agency — not becoming
      a lobbyist. Moreover, Trump actually weakened some of the
      language from similar bans under Obama and George W. Bush, and
      reduced the level of transparency.
