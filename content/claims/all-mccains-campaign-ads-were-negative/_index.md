    quote:
      But McCain has aired many, many ads that were not negative. If
      you look at a report from the same organization on Sept. 17, they
      found that in the week after the conventions, for example, Obama
      aired a higher percentage of negative ads than did McCain (76
      percent to 56 percent).


      In all, the Wisconsin Advertising Project has found that 73
      percent of McCain’s ads have been negative, to date. That's far
      short of 100 percent. (It also found 61 percent of Obama’s ads
      have been negative.)
