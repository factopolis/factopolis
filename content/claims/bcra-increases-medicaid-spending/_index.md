      â€¦ if the Senate bill as written by the date of his tweet becomes
      law, federal spending would be reduced by $772 billion over 10
      years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
      Moreover, 15 million fewer people would be enrolled in the
      program over 10 years than would be under current law.
