      Still, the president is right that there has been a decline in
      border apprehensions on his watch… But the president is wrong to
      say apprehensions have not gone down during other
      administrations.

      Then this talking point spins out of control when Trump falsely
      says border activity actually went up, not down, before his
      administration. In reality, illegal border crossings are back
      down to early-1970s levels, and apprehensions have steadily
      declined since their peak in 2000, with temporary upticks here
      and there. Trump earns Four Pinocchios.

      Though there have been fluctuations over the years in the number
      of apprehensions, they certainly have gone down under past
      administrations.
