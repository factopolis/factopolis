      Most importantly, there was no "massacre" in or around Bowling
      Green that was either carried out or attempted.


      In addition, while the two men were charged with serious crimes
      and were sentenced accordingly, it’s important to remember that
      everything that happened was part of a sting operation by the
      FBI. This means that the people of Bowling Green were not
      endangered at any point, and that the entire incident can be
      viewed as a law-enforcement success.
