    short:
      Clapper’s comments have not been as definitive as Trump
      said. Later that day, Clapper directly contradicted Trump’s
      claim in a TV interview.
    quote:
      As for Clapper’s statement, it’s apparent Trump has twisted the
      former DNI’s words to make it appear as if he’s ruled out the
      possibility that evidence exists showing the Trump campaign
      colluded with Russian interlopers during the 2016 election. But
      Clapper’s statement was that he had no knowledge of collusion --
      not that collusion didn’t occur. Clapper has since stated that
      his capacity as DNI would not necessarily give him the kind of
      access to the FBI investigation that one would need in order to
      determine whether or not evidence of collusion exists.
