      Contrary to Trump’s claim that he has “hundreds and hundreds of
      people” awaiting confirmation, the White House had, as of April
      7, put forward just 24 nominations for the 533 key posts that
      require Senate approval. Of those 24 nominees, 22 have been
      confirmed.

      Former President Barack Obama had 54 nominees confirmed by April
      7, 2009. Former President George W. Bush had 32 by April 7,
      2001, and Bill Clinton had 44 as of the same date in 1993.
