    "Senate Republicans [fell one vote short](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00179) of passing a bill that was seen as a placeholder — the so-called “skinny repeal” option, which could have then enabled the Senate and House to work on a final bill in a conference committee. In introducing the “skinny repeal” on July 27, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [said](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2017/07/27/CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4389.pdf): “Passing this legislation will allow us to work with our colleagues in the House toward a final bill that could go to the president, repeal Obamacare, and undo its damage.”


    Republicans were one vote away from continuing the process; they weren’t “one vote away from repealing” the law, as Trump claimed."
