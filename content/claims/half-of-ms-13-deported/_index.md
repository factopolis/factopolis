    short:
      Actually, the number is in the hundreds.
    quote:
      "For Trump to claim that half of the Ms-13 gang members have been
      deported would mean that his administration is responsible for
      about 5,000 removals of MS-13 members.


      Here’s why that is not possible: Danielle Bennett, a spokeswoman
      for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told us in an
      email for our earlier story that so far in fiscal year 2017 —
      from Oct. 1, 2016, to June 4, 2017 — ICE has removed 2,798 gang
      members. That includes all gang members, not just MS-13
      members. For perspective, the FBI says there are about 33,000
      street gangs with about 1.4 million members."
