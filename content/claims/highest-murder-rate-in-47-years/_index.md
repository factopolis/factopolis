       2015 is the most recent year the FBI released its annual report
       compiled by its Uniform Crime Reporting Program. FBI data for
       crime in the U.S. in that report shows that the murder rate in
       2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants -- the highest murder rate
       in six years. In 2009, the murder rate was at 5.0, while 10
       years ago, in 2007, the murder rate was at 5.7.

      According to the most recent FBI data available, an estimated
      15,696 murders occurred in the United States in 2015, or 4.9
      murders per 100,000 people. And while this was the highest
      murder rate in six years (compared to a range of 4.4 to 4.8
      murders per 100,000 each year since 2009, when the figure was 5
      per 100,000), itâ€™s less than half the historical high of 10.2 in
      1980.
