title: Hillary Clinton gave almost $700,000 to wife of FBI agent investigating her
summary: The timeline is wrong and the connections are exaggerated

    short:
      Nowhere in the Journal article does it say that Clinton was
      aware of the contributions, and Trump offered no evidence to
      support that claim. He also darkly suggested that these
      contributions ensured that Clinton was not prosecuted.
    quote:
      One might question whether Andrew McCabe should have recused
      himself from discussions over the email scandal, given the
      support his wife received from a Clinton confidant. But it’s
      hard to see how the trail runs to Clinton — or how McAuliffe
      would know that the husband of someone he was supporting in a
      Virginia legislative race was going to be promoted months later.


      By getting the timeline wrong and exaggerating the connections,
      Trump ends up in Three-Pinocchio range. But then, as he often
      does, Trump pushes the envelope and makes the unsupported claim
      that Clinton knew about the payments. It’s almost like he can’t
      help himself. That tips his statement about the Wall Street
      Journal article into Four-Pinocchio territory.

      article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-ally-aids-campaign-of-fbi-officials-wife-1477266114)
      doesn’t say that Clinton knew about the money.


      And Trump’s phrasing suggests that the donations to McCabe’s
      campaign were made while her husband was investigating Clinton’s
      emails. Not so.

      But for Trump's suggestion of a conspiracy to be true, McAuliffe
      and the Clintons would have had to hatch the scheme to buy favor

      office some five months before it was [first

      that the FBI was investigating whether Clinton mishandled
      classified information. Nor would it be known that such an
      investigation would be conducted out of Washington, not New
      York, since that was where the offending server was located.


      Also, according to the FBI, contributions to McCabe's campaign
      took place before her husband's involvement in the email
      investigation. And that involvement began after his wife's
      campaign had ended -- not during her candidacy, as Trump
      suggests.

      This tweet distorts key elements of the story, severely
      undercutting its accuracy.
    quote:
      A Virginia state candidate married to an FBI official did get
      donations from a longtime Clinton supporter, McAuliffe, who was
      also the Democratic governor of Virginia. But the tweet ignores
      at the spouse played no role in fundraising for his wife’s
      campaign, and it ignores that that McAuliffe made the donations
      on his own, for state-level political goals -- not to influence
      an investigation that Andrew McCabe wasn’t even involved in yet.

      But the contributions didn’t come from Clinton or her campaign,
      and Andrew McCabe wasn’t “in charge” of the FBI’s investigation
      of Clinton’s emails at the time of the donations, either.
