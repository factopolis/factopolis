    quote:
      His press secretary tried to soften the claim, but no matter how
      you look at it, that’s not accurate. In terms of absolute carbon
      dioxide emissions, California and New York rank No. 2 and
      No. 9. Texas is No. 1.


      Adjusting for population and GDP, California and New York are
      actually among the most effective states at reducing their
      impact on the atmosphere – beating even Sununu’s home state of
      New Hampshire.
