      While experts agree that prices tend to go up quickly after a
      market shock but usually come down more slowly once the shock is
      resolved, this phenomenon only occurs on a short-term basis -- a
      couple of weeks in most cases. Long-term data show long
      stretches since the mid 1970s when the inflation-adjusted price
      of gasoline and crude oil have fallen.
