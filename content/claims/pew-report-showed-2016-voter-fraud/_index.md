    short: … they did not claim it was evidence of actual fraud
    quote:
      "As we have written before, the 2012 report, “Inaccurate, Costly
      and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration
      System Needs an Upgrade,” found that “more than 1.8 million
      deceased individuals are listed as voters” and that
      “approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more
      than one state.”

      The report’s authors said it shows that voter rolls are
      “susceptible to fraud,” though they did not claim it was
      evidence of actual fraud. (Indeed, the Guardian reported that
      senior White House adviser Stephen Bannon was registered in two
      states.) Rather, Pew said that it is evidence of the need to
      upgrade voter registration systems."
