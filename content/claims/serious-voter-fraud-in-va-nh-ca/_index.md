      The top state election official in Virginia says the charge is
      "unfounded." The former chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign
      says he’s unaware of any "massive voter fraud on Election Day."

      Elections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said
      there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The state has
      some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the
      country. Allegations of fraud are so rare that Los Angeles
      County, the state’s largest county, does not track them.

      Those in charge of overseeing New Hampshire’s elections and
      investigating election complaints said any instances of voter
      fraud in the state have historically been extremely rare. The
      most recent election was no exception, with no complaints of
      voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000
      ballots were cast.
