    quote:
      The defense spending increase Trump laid out in his 2018 budget
      is not an unprecedented change, regardless of whether it
      includes war-related spending.


      Itâ€™s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to
      actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to
      appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap.
