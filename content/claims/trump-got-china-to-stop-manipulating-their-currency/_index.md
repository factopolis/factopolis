      While China has a history of pushing down its currency to drive
      up its exports, it hasn't done so in years. In fact, over the
      last few years, China has been propping up the yuan, not
      depressing it.

    short:
      While labeling China a currency manipulator now would look
      ridiculous, the United States should have done it a long time
      ago.
    quote:
      "By April 15, the Treasury Department is required to present to
      Congress a report on the exchange rate policies of the country’s
      major trading partners, intended to identify manipulators that
      cheapen their currency to make their exports more attractive and
      gain market share in the United States, a designation that could
      eventually lead to retaliation.


      It would be hard, these days, to find an economist who feels
      China fits the bill. Under a trade law passed in 2015, a country
      must meet three criteria: It would have to have a “material”
      trade surplus with the rest of the world, have a “significant”
      surplus with the United States, and intervene persistently in
      foreign exchange markets to push its currency in one direction.


      While China’s surplus with the United States is pretty big —
      almost $350 billion — its global surplus is modest, at 2.4
      percent of its gross domestic product last year. Most
      significant, it has been pushing its currency up, not
      down. Since the middle of 2014 it has sold over $1 trillion from
      its reserves to prop up the renminbi, under pressure from
      capital flight by Chinese companies and savers."
