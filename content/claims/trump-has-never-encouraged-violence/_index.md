    quote:
      We found one example — when Trump said, "If you see somebody
      getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them,
      would you?" — that clearly fits the criteria of promoting or
      encouraging violence.


      This was not an isolated incident; we found at least seven other
      examples in which Trump offered public musings that showed a
      tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition
      toward, physical violence.
