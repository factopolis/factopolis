      There is no evidence that we could find, however, that he spoke
      against the war *before* it started, although we did find he
      expressed early concerns about the cost and direction of the war
      a few months after it started.

      We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq
      War before the invasion where he seemed apprehensive but not
      vehemently opposed to the operation. In another interview, Trump
      said he supported the invasion.

      The record shows that Donald Trump’s public stand against the
      Iraq War did not occur until August 2004, long after the war was
      underway, and only after he had on multiple previous occasions
      expressed either support for the war or non-committal opinions
      about its merits. The record does not support his contention
      that he was against the Iraq War “from the beginning.”
