      In fact, as he approaches six months in office on Thursday, Mr.
      Trump is slightly behind the lawmaking pace for the past six
      presidents, who as a group signed an average of 43 bills during
      the same period. And an analysis of the bills Mr. Trump signed
      shows that about half were minor and inconsequential, passed by
      Congress with little debate. Among recent presidents, both the
      total number of bills he signed and the legislation’s substance
      make Mr. Trump about average.
