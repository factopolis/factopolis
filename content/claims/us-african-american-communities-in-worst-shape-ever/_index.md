    quote:
      Trumpâ€™s emphatic statement lacked any nuance. There is no
      comparison between the situation today and slavery, or the
      situation today and the Jim Crow era. Meanwhile, over the past
      half-century, African-Americans, despite consistently trailing
      whites, have made significant strides in life expectancy,
      educational attainment and other measures, and currently have
      unemployment and poverty rates that are near historical lows.
