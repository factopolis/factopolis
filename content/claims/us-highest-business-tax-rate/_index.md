title: US has the highest business tax rate
summary:
  The US does have a high *statutory* rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies pay a much lower rate on average; the *effective* tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate is the highest among large, advanced nations, it is not the highest in the world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.
