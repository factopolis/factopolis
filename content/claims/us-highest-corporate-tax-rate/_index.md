title: U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate
summary:
    Looking strictly at *statutory* tax rates among large industrialized nations this is true, but U.S. corporations get a lot of exemptions and deductions, pushing their *effective* tax rate (the rate corporations actually pay) down, well out of the top spot.
