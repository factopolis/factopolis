    short: WikiLeaks has certainly released classified information in the past.
    quote:
      During the general election, WikiLeaks released tens of
      thousands of emails that Russian actors stole from Democratic
      political operatives. Those emails do not contain classified
      information, as far as we know.


      However, WikiLeaks has certainly released classified information
      in the past. For example, Chelsea Manning (formerly known as
      Bradley Manning) made many thousands of classified and sensitive
      government files public through
      [WikiLeaks](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/01/john-mccain/mccain-says-taliban-murdered-people-because-chelse/).
