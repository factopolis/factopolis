**WORK IN PROGRESS**: this document is still very much a work in progress.

### Finding Content

Most statements on Factopolis come from spoken words, which generally means video these days. Good sources can be hard to find, but hopefully this document can help.

For video from a news network, the best option is usually [Archive.org's TV News Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv):

* [CNN](https://archive.org/details/TV-CNNW?sort=-date)
* [Fox News](https://archive.org/details/TV-FOXNEWSW?sort=-date)
* [MSNBC](https://archive.org/details/TV-MSNBCW?sort=-date)
* [BBC](https://archive.org/details/TV-BBCNEWS?sort=-date)
* [Fox Business](https://archive.org/details/TV-FBC?sort=-date)
* [Bloomberg](https://archive.org/details/TV-BLOOMBERG?sort=-date)
* [ABC](https://archive.org/details/TV-WJLA?sort=-date)

For Fox News and Fox Business, [video.foxnews.com](http://video.foxnews.com/) can also be a good source, but be prepared for a bunch of annoying ads you can't skip. You also can't start videos at a specific time, so if you can find a source on Archive.org please do so (Fox videos make for a good second copy of the video, though).

[C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/) has a good video player and an extensive archive. This is probably the best way to go for anything appearing on C-SPAN. They have very good coverage of things like debates and rallys. C-SPAN is also available on Archive.org ([C-SPAN](https://archive.org/details/TV-CSPAN), [C-SPAN2](https://archive.org/details/TV-CSPAN2), [C-SPAN3](https://archive.org/details/TV-CSPAN3)).

Other networks' official videos don't work as well:

* NBC, MSNBC, and ABC have embedded players which don't work over HTTPS (Factopolis is always served over HTTPS).
* CNN removes their videos after a while so they can charge for access to their archive.

For statements coming from the White House, the [White House Video Gallery](https://www.whitehouse.gov/featured-videos) has lots of videos, which are also made available through [their YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse).

Excercise caution when using YouTube sources; you should avoid using videos without a reputable organization behind them. Videos can be edited selectively (for example, compare [this YouTube video of Donald Trump's 2016-09-20 rally in Kenansville, NC](https://youtu.be/8ZADcyBDZSw?t=2396) with the [unedited video from C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?415591-1&start=2384); they've edited out [something significant](/person/donald-trump/2016-09-20/)!).

### Finding Content in Sources

Archive.org and C-SPAN have transcripts for most videos.

For YouTube, you can use http://downsub.com/ to download subtitles in SRT format, then open them up in a text editor.

For other sites, the best thing is generally to have a transcript open and use it as a guide. For White House videos, transcripts are generally posted pretty quickly for [Speeches & Remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-and-remarks), [Statements & Releases](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-and-releases), and [Press Briefings](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings). Many news channels post transcripts within 48 hours or so. Other than that, your best bet may be seaching for the event on Google with the word "transcript" appended. If you are able to find a transcript, please include a link to it; they may be useful for others, too.
