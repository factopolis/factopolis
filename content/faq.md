#### What makes Factopolis different?

Quite a bit, actually.

Most fact checking sites post walls of text detailing their analysis of a particular statement. Once these are posted they are rarely revised; if the claim is repeated later a new fact check may be written (likely linking to the old one), or it may be ignored since the claim has already been checked.

Factopolis, on the other hand, is intended as a living database. As new statements are made, either by the same person who made the initial claim or someone else, that information is added to the entry in our database for that claim.

This approach has several interesting benefits, including:

* It is much easier to explore a claim's history.
* Since we don't have to have a detailed fact check for every statement of a claim, information can be added more easily and quickly, meaning it should be possible to build a much more comprehensive database.
* Grouping multiple statements of the same claim together even when worded slightly differently inherently de-emphasizes the exact phrasing and forces us to instead focus on the core of a claim. Our hope is that this will make Factopolis less hospitable for weasel words and trickery.

Additionally, Factopolis is free; anyone can use the database to power their own applications and analysis. We even provide [an unrestricted API](/api) to make this as easy as possible. We don't know what people will build, but we're excited to find out!

Factopolis is collaboratively edited; anyone is free to submit information to the database. As long as it meets our quality standards (*i.e.*, appropriate and reliably sourced) we would be [happy to include it](/contributing).

Finally, due to our structure sources take a much more central role, and are more heavily emphasized. We often have multiple sources for statements (including video, audio, transcipts, *etc.*) which are easily accessible, making Factopolis extremely well-suited for research.

#### What do I do when a source has been removed or is otherwise inaccessible?

Unfortunately, media sites often remove old content so they can charge for access to it, and copies posted to YouTube are sometimes taken down over to copyright assertions.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues) as soon as possible and we'll do our best to find an alternative source.

#### What is the relationship between themes, claims, and statements?

Statements are specific instances of a person making a claim (i.e., a
single quote). Claims are what statements assert. Themes are collections
of claims which form a broader narrative.

For example, let's consider the "birther" movement. The theme is that
Barack Obama was not born in the United States (and therefore not
eligable to be President). There are several claims which contribute to
this theme, such as that Obama's grandmother said he was born in Kenya,
or his birth certificate is a forgery, or his college transcript says
he is an Indonesian citizen. Each time one of those claims was made is
a statement.

While all claims which make it onto Factopolis are currently, at least
to some degree, false, no judgements are about themes. It's entirely
possible to offer false evidence in support of something which is true.

#### Who is eligible to be on Factopolis?

Any political figure, at any level. Anyone from a local school board
representative's spokesperson to the President. Pundits are alse fair
game.

Celebrities are acceptable as long as the content is political in
nature, but are not a high priority.

Note that this isn't restricted to the United States, though Factopolis
itself is currently English-only. If you're interested in helping
launch a version of the site in another language, possibly focused on
another country, please contact us.

#### Why doesn't Factopolis include _______'s claim that _______?

Assuming such content would been our quality requirements, because you
haven't added it yet!

Factopolis is created and maintained by volunteers who have a finite
amount of time. If you feel something is missing, we would *love* for
you to [help](/contributing) fill in the gaps.

#### Is Factopolis a liberal/conservative effort to discredit _______?

We try very hard to examine issues for veracity as dispassionately as possible, discounting partisanship.

If you feel we have made a factual error we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible, but keep in mind that we don't generally do any fact checking ourselves. Our role is largely as an aggregator of fact checks done by [credible organizations](/checker).

#### How can I contact you?

We have a very strong preference for transparency, so whenever possible we try to make sure all discourse takes place in a public forum:

* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues) — our preferred medium.
* [Chat](https://gitter.im/factopolis/) — for those who prefer realtime communication.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/factopolisdb)

If you *really* need to communicate in private for some reason, you can e-mail [private@factopolis.com](mailto:private@factopolis.com). Please don't abuse this; if you don't have a good reason for needing privacy we're likely to just ask you to use a public forum and refuse to otherwise respond.
