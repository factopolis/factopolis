### Who is eligible to be on Factopolis?

Any political figure, at any level.  Anyone from a local school board
representative's spokesperson to the President.

Note that this isn't restricted to the United States, though
Factopolis itself is currently English-only.

### Why does Factopolis contain a disproportionate quantity of Donald Trump's claims?

 * Our initial data source was The New York Times' ["Trump's
   Lies"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html)
   article. This was a convenient way to get a lot of data, which was
   vital for developing and proving the concepts behind Factopolis.
 * Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America, so
   fact checkers are more likely to pay attention to his comments.

Beyond that, we don't want to make any assumptions. Factopolis is very
new, and our belief is that anomalies in the data will stablize over
time. Once a sufficient amount of time has passed Factopolis' only
bias should be in favor of the truth.
