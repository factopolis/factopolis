    quote:
      But what I have done — and this is unprecedented, by the way, no
      administration has done this before — is I’ve said to each
      agency, don't just look at current regulations — or don't just
      look at future regulations, regulations that we’re proposing,
      let’s go backwards and look at regulations that are already on
      the books, and if they don't make sense, let’s get rid of them.

    quote:
      Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable
      Care Act came into law and you really like that plan, what we
      said was you could keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law was
      passed.  So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act you’re
      grandfathered in on that plan.
