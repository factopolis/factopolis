    The ARIS survey did not attempt to estimate the number of Muslim children, as the Pew Research Center did. So we judge Pew’s 2.35 million figure to be the best available estimate of the total U.S. Muslim population.


    That’s also the figure used by the Wikipedia ranking of [countries with the largest Muslim populations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country), which puts the U.S. at No. 52. There are [by most counts](http://geography.about.com/cs/countries/a/numbercountries.htm) 195 countries in the world, so the U.S. would be in the top half, though not in the top one-quarter.

    Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. Indeed, by even the most generous estimate we found of 8 million, the United States still ranks 29 out of 60.
