  But what I have done — and this is unprecedented, by the way, no
  administration has done this before — is I’ve said to each agency,
  don't just look at current regulations — or don't just look at future
  regulations, regulations that we’re proposing, let’s go backwards and
  look at regulations that are already on the books, and if they don't
  make sense, let’s get rid of them.
