    Without considering how debt is measured and held, what kinds of assets each group owns, or how the currencies are converted, it's hard to make heads or tails of what wealth actually means, with respect to people's daily lives around the globe. Moreover, negative wealth — which includes people with high standards of living — really drags down the bottom 50 percent. Sanders's statistic, while provocative, is basically meaningless.
  short: Sanders's statistic, while provocative, is basically meaningless.

  quote:
    According to global wealth disparity research, it is factually accurate to say that six men are, collectively, richer than the bottom 50 percent of the world.


    However, an expert cautioned about reading too much into this specific statistic because of the way wealth is measured and improvements in data collection.
