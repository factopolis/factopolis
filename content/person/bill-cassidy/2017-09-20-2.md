  quote:
    Cassidy is being fairly misleading when he claims "the protection is absolutely the same." Depending on the state, the protection for preexisting conditions could be the same -- or people with cancer or other serious illnesses could find themselves in a high-risk pool being charged extraordinarily high premiums.
