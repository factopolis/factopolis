  You know, first, most Planned Parenthood settings are in urban areas, urban areas that have lots of OB/GYNs... Now, as it turns out, the folks who don’t have access to those cancer screenings live in rural areas. They live in areas where there are not enough physicians. So the idea is that we want someone to have to drive -- a lower-income person drive -- three hours to a Planned Parenthood facility there to get her screening, or would we rather take that money and put it back in the rural area to allow her to get her health care there?
