    "The figures come from Americans for Tax Fairness, a group that advocates \"progressive tax reform\" that \"requires big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share,\" but Schumer doesn’t quite get them right. ATF said the cost of the plan could be $7 trillion to $8 trillion over 10 years, while the portion added to the deficit could be $3 trillion to $5 trillion over 10 years. The headline on the analysis said: \"Trump’s Unpaid-For Tax Cuts May Total $5 Trillion In New Tax Plan.\""
