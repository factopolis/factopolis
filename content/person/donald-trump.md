          announced by Marillyn, who’s very talented, the head of
          Lockheed Martin. I got involved in that about a month ago. A
          lot was put out, and when they say a lot, a lot meant about
          90 planes. They were having a lot of difficulty. There was
          no movement and I was able to get $600 million approximately
          off those planes.
