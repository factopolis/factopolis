  That was a prime site for river crossings. So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot — a lot of them.

  You don’t have to talk to anybody. It doesn’t make any difference. But many people were shot. It makes sense.

    The club does indeed lie a stone’s throw from [Rowser’s Ford](http://www.funinfairfaxva.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Rowsers-Ford-Seneca-Tract.jpg), where, as an official historical marker notes, Gen. J. E. B. Stuart led 5,000 Confederate troops including cavalry across the Potomac en route to the [Battle of Gettysburg](http://topics.NYTimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/civil_war_us/battle_of_gettysburg/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier).


    But no one died in that crossing, historians said, or in any other notable Civil War engagement on the spot.
