quote:
  "They were having terrorism problems, just like we do, And he caught
  50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And
  he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50
  bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets,
  and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his
  rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those
  people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people,
  and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a
  problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem."
