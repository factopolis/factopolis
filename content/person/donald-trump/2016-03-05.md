quote:
  You know I told this story and some people said it wasn't necessarily true, and then it has turned out to be true, but I tell this story, it's a rough story. Should I tell it or not? Alright, remember they asked me to tell it, so it's not my fault.


  But in the old days when we were strong and respected, we had a general named General Pershing. Very tough cookie, we have — hey, General Patton. How long do you think — hey — how long do you think ISIS would last with the great General George Patton? With the great General Douglas MacArthur? Believe me.


  But around 1919, they had a problem with Islam—I mean, they had a problem with terrorsim. Radical Islamic terrorism, okay? They had a big, big problem. Tremendous atrocities were being committed. And General Perhing and his group were sent out to solve the problem, and they caught 50 terrorists, and they took those terrorists and they stood them up — all 50 — and they took the bullets, and they cut open two pigs and they dropped the bullets into the pigs and they took the pig's blood and they splashed it around, and they then took those bullets, they put them in the guns, they shot 49 of the terrorists with the bullets loaded up with pig fat and pig blood, which is not something that — let me explain. Not nice, not politically correct. I don't think they would allow that today, do you agree? They shot 49 of the 50 terrorists, and the final terrorist, just before he was going to be shot, they went up to him, they said, "Here, take this bullet, this bullet was meant for you," and he hardly wanted to touch it. "Take this bullet, it was meant for you. Go back and tell your people there will be no more terrorism."  For 28 years there was no more terrorism. For 28 years there was no more terrorism. Look it up, in the Philippines. General Pershing. 28 years, there was no more terrorism.
