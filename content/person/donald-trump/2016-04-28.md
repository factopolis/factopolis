quote:
  So General Pershing was sent there to solve a really serious terror problem.  They caught 50 radical Islamic terrorists.  They caught them.  They took the 50, they lined them up.  They took a pig and then they took a second pig.  And they cut the pig open.  And they took the bullets from the rifles, and they dumped the bullets into the pigs, and they swashed it around.  And then they took the bullets and shot 49 of the 50 people.


  And the 50th person, they said, take this bullet, and bring it back to all of the people causing the problem and tell them what happened tonight.  He took the bullet.  He brought it back, that 50th person.  And for 42 years, they didn't have a problem with radical Islamic terrorism, folks, OK?  Believe me.
