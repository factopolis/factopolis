  short:
    By all metrics we looked at, the United States is far from the most taxed nation overall and for businesses.
  quote:
    Data from 2014, the most recent year available, shows that the United States wasn’t the most highly taxed by the typical metrics and actually places near the bottom or around the middle of the pack.


    Trump specified this time that he was talking about business taxes, but the essential data doesn’t back him there, either.


    Trump would have been more accurate if he had been more specific. The United States does have one of the highest top marginal corporate tax rates in the world. However, companies pay less in practice because they can take deductions and exclusions. When we look at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it’s far from highest in the world.
