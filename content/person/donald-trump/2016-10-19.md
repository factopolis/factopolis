  The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.
  You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion
  was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State
  Department, $6 billion was either stolen — they don't know. It's
  gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to
  be in some mess. Believe me.

    The $6 billion figure comes from a State Department inspector general report that found paperwork for various contracts had been mismanaged. The $6 billion was not missing or stolen — it had been doled out in a number of contracts — but the paperwork was missing.
