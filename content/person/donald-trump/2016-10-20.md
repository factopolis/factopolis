  The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.
  You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion
  was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State
  Department, $6 billion was either stolen â€” they don't know. It's
  gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to
  be in some mess. Believe me.
