  And yet, Obama today spoke in front of a much smaller crowd than
  this, by the way, and there was a protester and a protester that
  likes us. And what happened is they wouldn't put the cameras on
  them. They kept the cameras on Obama, and I said, "That's strange."
  You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the
  protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him.

    Obama defended the protester's right to speak out, and didn’t scream at him. In fact, Obama’s remarks were directed at Clinton supporters, not the protester.
