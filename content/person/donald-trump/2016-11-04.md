  And yet, Obama today spoke in front of a much smaller crowd than
  this, by the way, and there was a protester and a protester that
  likes us. And what happened is they wouldn't put the cameras on
  them. They kept the cameras on Obama, and I said, "That's strange."
  You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the
  protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him.
