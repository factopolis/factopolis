    While the letter does note that the New York Times underestimated support for Trump, it does not say their coverage of him throughout the campaign was bad. In fact, the letter praises New York Times reportersâ€™ work.

    The note does not include any semblance of an apology.

    There was no apology in the letter, but the president is trying hard to convince voters that there was.
