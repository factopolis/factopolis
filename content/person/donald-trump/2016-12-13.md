  We're also going to lower our business tax rates so that new companies will come to our shores and hire workers in cities like right here. Is that OK? That's what we want. We're going to bring our rates down from 35 percent, we're going to try to get it down to 15 percent. So, right now -- and by the way the jobs will pour in -- so, right now, we're the highest-taxed nation in the world.

    The top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, highest among the worldâ€™s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations have the same rate and two smaller ones, United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent.


    Also, the 35 percent U.S. rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes.
