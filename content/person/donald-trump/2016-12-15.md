  quote:
    About a month before the Nov. 8  election, the Obama administration accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections, directing the release of emails "from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations."


    This didnâ€™t happen under the radar. Trump was confronted with it at the final presidential debate.
