  But we cut approximately $600 million off the F-35 fighter, and that
  only amounts to 90 planes out of close to 3,000 planes. And when you
  think about $600 million, it was announced by Marillyn, who’s very
  talented, the head of Lockheed Martin. I got involved in that about a
  month ago. A lot was put out, and when they say a lot, a lot meant
  about 90 planes. They were having a lot of difficulty. There was no
  movement and I was able to get $600 million approximately off those
  planes.

    But Lockheed already had planned cost reductions. In a Dec. 19 briefing — before Trump began meeting with Hewson — the head of the Defense Department’s F-35 Joint Program Office, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, announced costs would come down “significantly.” The next stage in the F-35 program’s low-rate initial production was a new batch of 90 airplanes, called Lot 10. Bogdan had estimated that Lot 10 planes would cost “somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane” less than Lot 9 planes.


    Between 6 to 7 percent comes out to a cost reduction of between $6.1 million and $7.1 million per plane, or between $549 million and $630 million for a full lot of 90 planes, The Washington Post’s [Aaron Gregg reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/30/trump-says-lockheed-martin-has-cut-600-million-from-f-35-program/). This cost reduction is already reflected in the Air Force’s budget.
