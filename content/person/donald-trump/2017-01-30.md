  But we cut approximately $600 million off the F-35 fighter, and that
  only amounts to 90 planes out of close to 3,000 planes. And when you
  think about $600 million, it was announced by Marillyn, whoâ€™s very
  talented, the head of Lockheed Martin. I got involved in that about a
  month ago. A lot was put out, and when they say a lot, a lot meant
  about 90 planes. They were having a lot of difficulty. There was no
  movement and I was able to get $600 million approximately off those
  planes.
