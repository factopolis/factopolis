    This refers to the number of people who were in transit when the ban was announced. It doesnâ€™t account for people who tried to board flights to the United States (over 1,200) and were denied, for visas that were revoked (about 60,000 according to the State Department) or for refugees admitted (64,000 in the last two fiscal years).
