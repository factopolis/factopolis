  Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland, as

  Bernardino and all across Europe.


  You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's
  happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.
  And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to
  report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.
