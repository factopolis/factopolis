  Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland, as
  they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando to San
  Bernardino and all across Europe.


  You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's
  happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.
  And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to
  report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.
