  Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland, as
  they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando to San
  Bernardino and all across Europe.


  You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's
  happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.
  And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to
  report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.

    We found no support for the idea that the media is hushing up terrorist attacks on U.S. or European soil. The media may sometimes be cautious about assigning religious motivation to a terrorist attack when the facts are unclear or still being investigated. But that’s not the same as covering them up through lack of coverage. There is plenty of coverage of in the American media of terrorist attacks.
