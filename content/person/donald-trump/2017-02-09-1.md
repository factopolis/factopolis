    Not so. Cuomo, a CNN host, brought up that issue upfront with Blumenthal on Thursday. Cuomo asked him about Trump’s belief that the senator has no credibility “because you misrepresented your military record in the past.” Blumenthal did not answer the question, but went on to talk about his meeting with Judge Gorsuch.
