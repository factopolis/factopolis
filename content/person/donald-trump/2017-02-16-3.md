    WikiLeaks actually released [hundreds of thousands](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/28/AR2010112802395.html) of classified State Department cables, in a significant blow to U.S. diplomacy.

  quote:
    During the general election, WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of emails that Russian actors stole from Democratic political operatives. Those emails do not contain classified information, as far as we know.


      However, WikiLeaks has certainly released classified information in the past. For example, Chelsea Manning (formerly known as Bradley Manning) made many thousands of classified and sensitive government files public through [WikiLeaks](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/01/john-mccain/mccain-says-taliban-murdered-people-because-chelse/).
