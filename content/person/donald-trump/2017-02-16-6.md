    Despite denials from the campaign and the White House, it is now clear that members of the Trump campaign interacted with Russians at least 30 times throughout the campaign. (There are 21 known meetings.) Knowledge of these communications went to the highest levels of Donald Trump’s operation — both Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, two of the campaign’s three managers, were aware of it.
