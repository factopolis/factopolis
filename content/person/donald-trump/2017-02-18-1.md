  We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in
  Germany. You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden,
  who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re
  having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what’s
  happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the
  world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.
