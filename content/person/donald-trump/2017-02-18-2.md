  short:
    Trump is referring to the Lockheed F-35 program. Again, he is [taking credit for something that had already been negotiated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/31/trumps-claim-taking-credit-for-cutting-600-million-from-the-f-35-program/?utm_term=.8060136c3fc7), a claim that had previously earned him Four Pinocchios. The Pentagon had already announced cost reductions of about $600 million before Trump met with Lockheed's chief executive.
