  By the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed — there are
  lines that go back six blocks.  And I tell you that because you won’t
  read about it, okay?  But there are lines that go back six blocks.
  There is such love in this country for everything we stand for. You
  saw that on Election Day.  And you’re going to see it more and more.
