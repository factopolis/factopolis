  But a few years ago, the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean
  nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer’s land or anyplace
  else that they decide. Right? It was a massive power grab. The EPA’s
  regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of
  thousands and regulations and permits started treating our wonderful
  small farmers and small businesses as if they were a major industrial
  polluter. They treated them horribly. Horribly.

    The focus of our fact-check is whether the rule cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs,” and there is no evidence to support that. After the rule was issued in 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a nationwide stay blocking it from taking effect. We checked with key industry groups that opposed the rule, but did not find research into the impact of the rule on jobs after it was halted in 2015. The rule has been in limbo since, so it is not credible that any jobs have been lost.
