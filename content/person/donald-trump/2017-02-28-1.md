  But a few years ago, the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean
  nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer’s land or anyplace
  else that they decide. Right? It was a massive power grab. The EPA’s
  regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of
  thousands and regulations and permits started treating our wonderful
  small farmers and small businesses as if they were a major industrial
  polluter. They treated them horribly. Horribly.
