    While the Trump White House cited five news reports to justify its request for a congressional investigation, only two actually are relevant... Even if these media reports are accepted as accurate, neither back up Trumpâ€™s claims that Obama ordered the tapping of his phone calls.

    There is no new detail in the Sept. 19 CNN report that warrants a change to our original Four-Pinocchio rating. Trump had claimed that Obama ordered the wiretapping of his phones in Trump Tower just before the presidential election. That allegation remains unproven.
