  Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!


  ...


  How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!

  short:
    It is the responsibility of the politician making a claim to provide information to support it. But Trump has failed to do so.

    While the Trump White House cited five news reports to justify its request for a congressional investigation, only two actually are relevant... Even if these media reports are accepted as accurate, neither back up Trump’s claims that Obama ordered the tapping of his phone calls.

    There is no new detail in the Sept. 19 CNN report that warrants a change to our original Four-Pinocchio rating. Trump had claimed that Obama ordered the wiretapping of his phones in Trump Tower just before the presidential election. That allegation remains unproven.

    There is still much that we don't know about the ongoing federal investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign. It may be that Manafort -- as CNN reported -- was the target of a court-ordered wiretap. It may even turn out that Trump was inadvertently picked up if he spoke to Manafort when the court order was in place.


    But there is no evidence to support Trump’s tweets accusing Obama of illegally wiretapping his phones. That was the case in March, and it remains so.
