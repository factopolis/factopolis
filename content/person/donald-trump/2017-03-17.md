  quote:
    Tennessee divides the state into eight rating areas. Three of the eight — the East, Greater Nashville and Greater Memphis areas — have two carriers selling health insurance on the federal marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, according to the state’s 2017 rating area plans and rates. The other five rating areas have only one carrier.


    It is important that at least one company is selling insurance on the marketplace in each rating area, because the federal government provides tax credits and subsidies to help pay for insurance only for those who purchase plans on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.
