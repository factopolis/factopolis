quote:
  Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times, “Wiretapped
  data used in inquiry of Trump aides.” That’s a headline. Now they
  then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They
  then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without
  the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in
  inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn’t like it. And
  they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out.
