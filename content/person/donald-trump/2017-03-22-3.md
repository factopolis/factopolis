  Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times, “Wiretapped
  data used in inquiry of Trump aides.” That’s a headline. Now they
  then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They
  then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without
  the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in
  inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn’t like it. And
  they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out.

  quote:
    Mr. Trump was referring to an article published online on Jan. 19 and in print on Jan. 20 that disclosed that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of Mr. Trump.


    There were in fact two different headlines on the online and print versions of the article, which is typical. At no point was either headline altered.


    Times headlines often differ in print and online, in part because of variations in presentation and in part because of space. This disparity is always noted at the end of the web version and has been noted since the story was first published in print on Jan. 20.
