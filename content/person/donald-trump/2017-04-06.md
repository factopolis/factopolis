  If you look at the kind of cost-cutting we’ve been able to achieve
  with the military and at the same time ordering vast amounts of
  equipment — saved hundreds of millions of dollars on airplanes, and
  really billions, because if you take that out over a period of years
  it’s many billions of dollars — I think we’ve had a tremendous
  success.
