  I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my

  quote:
    David Bossie, a conservative activist who worked with Mr. Bannon on a series of films, made the introduction. “They definitely hit it off,” Mr. Bossie told Scott Shane of The New York Times in November.


    Mr. Bannon joked in August 2015 that he was Mr. Trump’s hidden “campaign manager,” and he hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in November 2015.


    “I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years,” Mr. Trump said in an August 2016 statement announcing Mr. Bannon as his campaign’s chief executive and Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager. “They are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win.”
