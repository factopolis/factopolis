  You can't do it faster, because they're obstructing. They're
  obstructionists. So I have people — hundreds of people that we're
  trying to get through. I mean you have — you see the backlog. We
  can't get them through.

    As of Wednesday, Mr. Trump had yet to nominate anyone for 478 out of more than 533 crucial appointments, according to the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition. Of 24 nominations Mr. Trump has sent to the Senate, 22 have been confirmed; 29 other appointments have been announced but not formally submitted.

    Contrary to Trump’s claim that he has “hundreds and hundreds of people” awaiting confirmation, the White House had, as of April 7, put forward just 24 nominations for the 533 key posts that require Senate approval. Of those 24 nominees, 22 have been confirmed.


    Former President Barack Obama had 54 nominees confirmed by April 7, 2009. Former President George W. Bush had 32 by April 7, 2001, and Bill Clinton had 44 as of the same date in 1993.
