  quote:
    He’s talking about the fact that in 2016 NATO created an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Experts said the change was not especially significant, and Trump wasn’t the catalyst. The development had been in the works for years.


    …


    Further, Trump’s comment gives the incorrect impression that NATO wasn’t responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. In reality, NATO has been actively dealing with terrorism since the 1980s. And since 9/11, it has played a significant role in the War on Terror, including deploying troops in Afghanistan for more than a decade.
