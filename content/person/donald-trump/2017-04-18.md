quote:
  The fake media goes, “Donald Trump has changed his stance on China.”
  I haven’t changed my stance. China is trying to help us. I don’t know
  if they’re going to be able to or not. But why would I want to start
  heavy heavy trade or currency statements against somebody who is out
  there right now trying to stop what could be a very bad situation.
  You understand that.
