quote:
  The fake media goes, “Donald Trump has changed his stance on China.”
  I haven’t changed my stance. China is trying to help us. I don’t know
  if they’re going to be able to or not. But why would I want to start
  heavy heavy trade or currency statements against somebody who is out
  there right now trying to stop what could be a very bad situation.
  You understand that.

  quote:
    As a candidate, Trump pitched himself as the antidote to what he said had become a one-sided relationship with China. He promised to label China a currency manipulator on Day One, something he has now said he has no immediate plans to do, and to make more even the trade relationship between the two nations.


    In the interview that aired Tuesday, Trump left open the possibility that China might ultimately be unable, or unwilling, to apply sufficient pressure on North Korea.
