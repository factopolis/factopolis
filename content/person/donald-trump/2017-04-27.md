  quote:
    Trump’s tweet that "Democrats are blocking their healthcare" is disingenuous. The senator leading the effort to make funding for the health insurance program permanent is a Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The bill Manchin has proposed has 18 Democratic cosponsors, and seven Republicans are also on board.


    At an [April 26 press conference](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=CF9018FE-4A1E-40BA-B1A3-E98111A6798F), Manchin said Trump had called him to say he supports Manchin’s efforts.
