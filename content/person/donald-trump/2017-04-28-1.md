    For the second year in a row, the U.S. had a trade *surplus* with Canada. In 2016, the U.S. had an $8.1 billion trade surplus in goods and services with Canada, up nearly 33 percent from the $6.1 billion surplus in 2015. The last time the U.S. had a deficit with Canada was 2014.


    Typically, when referring to trade deficits, Trump counts only goods and not services. But, even if that were the case here, he would be overstating the U.S. trade deficit for goods with Canada.


    The [U.S. trade deficit for goods was $11.2 billion](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c1220.html) with Canada in 2016, so Trump would have overstated the trade deficit for goods by $5.8 billion, or more than half. Not only that, but the trade deficit for goods has dropped significantly over the last few decades. It was $78.3 billion in 2008. The $11.2 billion trade deficit in goods is the lowest it has been since 1993, when it was $10.8 billion.

  short: The U.S. had an $8.1 billion trade surplus, not deficit, with Canada in 2016.
