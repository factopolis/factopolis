  # No rating because PF included the more ambiguous "everybody else" part.
  short:
    Clapper’s comments have not been as definitive as Trump
    said. Later that day, Clapper directly contradicted Trump’s
    claim in a TV interview.
  quote:
    As for Clapper’s statement, it’s apparent Trump has twisted the former DNI’s words to make it appear as if he’s ruled out the possibility that evidence exists showing the Trump campaign colluded with Russian interlopers during the 2016 election. But Clapper’s statement was that he had no knowledge of collusion -- not that collusion didn’t occur. Clapper has since stated that his capacity as DNI would not necessarily give him the kind of access to the FBI investigation that one would need in order to determine whether or not evidence of collusion exists.
