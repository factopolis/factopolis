  China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.

  agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by
  2020.

  short:
    The agreement never uses the word coal, much less spells out how many coal-fired plants any country can build.
  quote:
    It forces neither China nor the United States to do or not do anything.


    China’s voluntary plan to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions does allow emissions to rise until 2030, but it also moves the country away from reliance on coal, and the tangible results have been the cancellation of over 100 new coal-fired plants.


    Neither the law nor realities on the ground support Trump’s statement.

  quote:
    This is false. The agreement is nonbinding and each nation sets its own targets. There is nothing in the agreement that stops the United States from building coal plants or gives the permission to China or India to build coal plants. In fact, market forces, primarily reduced costs for natural gas, have forced the closure of coal plants. China announced this year that it would cancel plans to build more than 100 coal-fired plants.
