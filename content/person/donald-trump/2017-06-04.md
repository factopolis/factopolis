  quote:
    Trump portrayed Khan as an official with his head in the sand about the attacks that disrupted his city. The reality is the president plucked five words from the mayor’s longer message that condemned the terrorist acts and explained why Londoners would see an increased police presence in the coming days. Khan was not saying there is "no reason to be alarmed," period,  by the attack -- he was pre-empting concerns about what law enforcement presence might mean in the days to come.

  quote:
    Mayor Sadiq Khan was attempting to reassure the people of London that a greater police presence they might see in the aftermath of the previous day’s attack was a public safety precaution; he was not indicating that another attack was imminent or that citizens should “not be alarmed” by what had occurred.

  short: The mayor was specifically talking about the enlarged police presence on the streets.
