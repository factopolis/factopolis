    Trump did not approve either pipeline on his first day. Four days into his presidency, he issued executive orders that advanced the two pipelines, but did not grant final approval. The government announced the approval of the Dakota Access pipeline three weeks into his presidency; Trump [approved Keystone XL two months into his presidency](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/03/24/us-grants-permit-for-keystone-xl-pipeline-transcanada-says.html).
