    Actually, the number is in the hundreds.
  quote:
    "For Trump to claim that half of the Ms-13 gang members have been deported would mean that his administration is responsible for about 5,000 removals of MS-13 members.


    Here’s why that is not possible: Danielle Bennett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told us in an email for our earlier story that so far in fiscal year 2017 — from Oct. 1, 2016, to June 4, 2017 — ICE has removed 2,798 gang members. That includes all gang members, not just MS-13 members. For perspective, the FBI says there are about 33,000 street gangs with about 1.4 million members."
