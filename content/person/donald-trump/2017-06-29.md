    President Trump is misusing the term "bailout." Insurance companies donâ€™t make money through cost-sharing -- they are being paid back for money they've already spent on behalf of people who purchased their health plans. The president either doesn't understand the process or is being purposely misleading. He earns Four Pinocchios.
