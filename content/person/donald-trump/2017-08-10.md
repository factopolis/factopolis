    "[America’s tax revenue](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-us-taxes-compare-internationally) is 26 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is significantly lower than the average 34 percent other developed countries pay relative to their GDP, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Denmark, France and Sweden are among those nations that top America on taxes.


    The U.S. tax burden per capita — $14,115 — also is below average in relation to other developed nations, as well, [data from the Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/oecd-gross-domestic-product-tax-revenue-population-1965-2014) shows. By the numbers, the U.S. corporate tax rate is on the high side, but deductions bring it back down to the average range worldwide, experts said."
