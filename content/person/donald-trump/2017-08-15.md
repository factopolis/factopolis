  "The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people:
  neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But
  you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently
  protest — and very legally protest, because you know- I don't know if
  you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit."

    But they did have permits for rallies on Saturday — and they did not need one to go into or gather near Emancipation Park, where white nationalists scheduled their rally. No permits were needed to march on the U-Va. campus on Friday night.

    In reality, both the Unite the Right marchers and the counter-protesters had official permission to assemble on Saturday, either from a court or from the city.

    Technically, counter-protesters were the only ones who had a city permit for 12 August 2017 events. For the UVA “alt-right” rally the night before, no permits were needed and it was a judge’s injunction on the night of 11 August 2017 that allowed the “Unite the Right” rally to be held the next day at Emancipation Park.
