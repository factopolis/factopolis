quote:
  "I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more
  closely than you people watched it, and you have- You had a group on
  one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was
  also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it
  right now. You had a group, you had a group on the other side that
  came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent.


  …


  The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people:
  neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But
  you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently
  protest — and very legally protest, because you know- I don't know if
  you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit."
