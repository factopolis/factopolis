  quote:
    In fact, the U.S. still imports more energy than it exports. It’s true that U.S. imports have been falling, and exports have been rising. But that trend didn’t start “recently.” Net imports peaked in 2005, and have been falling nearly every year for well over a decade.

  quote:
    This statement is problematic regardless of how you interpret his statement -- gross energy exports, net energy exports, gross crude-oil exports, and net natural gas exports. The closest he would come to being accurate is if he were referring to net natural gas exports, but even there, it hasn’t happened yet, contrary to what his past-tense statement indicates.
