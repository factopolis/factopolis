  We got great legislation. You ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but Trump hasn't gotten -- I think we've gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months, I think we've gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we've got none.

    As of Aug. 22, Trump had signed 54 pieces of legislation into law, [according to](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?status=28,29,32,33&sort=-current_status_date) GovTrack.us. But no one has said that he has “signed none.”


    What some have pointed out, however, is that Trump [has not](http://www.npr.org/2017/06/23/533840991/despite-claims-to-contrary-trump-has-signed-no-major-laws-5-months-in) [signed many](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-the-bills-donald-trump-has-signed/), [if any](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/donald-trump-six-months/index.html), significant pieces of legislation into law. For example, Trump has not fulfilled some of his biggest campaign promises. Efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act [stalled](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/27/politics/health-care-debate-thursday/index.html) in the Senate. And Trump has yet to sign a bill funding the construction of a border wall with Mexico, nor has he signed legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code or following through on his promise of [$1 trillion in infrastructure programs](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-infrastructure-worries-20170609-story.html).
