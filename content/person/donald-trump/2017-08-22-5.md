    When Trump [falsely](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/03/donald-trump/false-trumps-claim-about-illegal-immigration-under/) claimed something similar in July, we found that the closest number to 78-80 percent would be based on cherry-picked numbers of the highest number of apprehensions, in November, to the lowest number, in April.


    The [latest figures](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration) from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that in July there were 18,198 apprehensions at the southwest border, a [46 percent decline](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children/fy-2016) from July 2016. While apprehension numbers are low under Trump, they began increasing in May.
