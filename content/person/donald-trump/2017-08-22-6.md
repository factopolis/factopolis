quote:
  The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did.

  quote:
    A Nov. 13 letter to readers from the New York Times’ publisher and executive editor mainly thanks readers for their loyalty and says that the publication will "rededicate" itself to the high journalistic standards it has employed thus far.


    Nowhere in the letter did the authors write anything like an apology. Nor did they say that the organization’s overall coverage of Trump was "bad."

  quote:
    Trump has claimed multiple times that the Times "apologized," though this time he seemed to back off slightly by saying it "essentially" apologized. Either way, the New York Times did not apologize, as NPR's Jessica Taylor wrote in a [fact-check](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/27/511216062/president-trumps-tweets-annotated?post=825328817833123840) of a Jan. 29 Trump tweet.
