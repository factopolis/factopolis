  quote:
    Trump’s proposed base spending cap for 2017-18 defense spending is $603 billion, a 9.4 percent increase.


    There have been 10 years since 1977 when the base level has gone up by more than that, and in some years, the increase more than doubled Trump’s.


    In 1981, President Ronald Reagan hiked the spending cap by 24.9 percent and by 20.4 percent the following year. More recently, President George W. Bush bumped spending by 10 percent in 2009.


    It’s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap.

    He hasn’t. His proposed budget for fiscal 2018 would increase defense spending by 5 percent — far less than the double-digit increases under Presidents George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.
