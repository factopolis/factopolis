quote:
  "So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: “We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia” -- this is me speaking. “We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.” That's me speaking on Saturday.


  Right after the event.


  So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, “egregious display,” “hatred, bigotry and violence.” OK, I think I can't do much better, right? OK. But they didn't want to put this on. They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough. He didn't do it on time. Why did it take a day? He must be a racist. It took a day."
