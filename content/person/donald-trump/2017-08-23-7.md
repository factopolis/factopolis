  "So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: “We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia” -- this is me speaking. “We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.” That's me speaking on Saturday.


  Right after the event.


  So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, “egregious display,” “hatred, bigotry and violence.” OK, I think I can't do much better, right? OK. But they didn't want to put this on. They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough. He didn't do it on time. Why did it take a day? He must be a racist. It took a day."

    But Trump did not read the portion of his comments that were criticized by Republicans and Democrats for not explicitly condemning the racist, anti-Semitic protesters.

    "Trump did say that, but he left out the second part of that sentence. The full sentence was: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides — on many sides” (per a transcript from Vox).


    It was that “many sides” part that angered many people — it appeared to put the KKK, neo-Nazi and other white supremacist rallygoers on the same moral footing as the counterprotesters who opposed them."

    Actually, Trump said, “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, **on many sides. On many sides**.” In his retelling, Trump left out the words in bold.

    But, again, Trump did not repeat the phrase that drew criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike and prompted several of his advisory boards to disband in protest. While quoting himself, Trump did not mention his remark that “there’s blame on both sides.”
