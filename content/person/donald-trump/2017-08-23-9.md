quote:
  Obamacare is a disaster and think -- think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace. One vote away. One vote away. We were one vote away. Think of it, seven years the Republicans -- and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it.

    "Senate Republicans [fell one vote short](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00179) of passing a bill that was seen as a placeholder — the so-called “skinny repeal” option, which could have then enabled the Senate and House to work on a final bill in a conference committee. In introducing the “skinny repeal” on July 27, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [said](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2017/07/27/CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4389.pdf): “Passing this legislation will allow us to work with our colleagues in the House toward a final bill that could go to the president, repeal Obamacare, and undo its damage.”


    Republicans were one vote away from continuing the process; they weren’t “one vote away from repealing” the law, as Trump claimed."
