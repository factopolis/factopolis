quote:
  Just to add on, tremendous drugs are pouring into the United States at levels that nobody has ever seen before.  This happened over the last three to four years in particular.  The wall will stop much of the drugs from pouring into this country and poisoning our youth. So we need the wall.  It's imperative.

    Most drugs come into the United States across the southern border with Mexico. But a wall would not limit this illegal trade, as much of it travels through legal borders or under tunnels unaffected by any possible physical barrier.

    Several experts cast doubt on the wall's potential effect. They noted that much of the illegal drugs coming into the United States arrive through legal ports of entry and that smugglers also use other tools that a wall wouldn't stop (even catapults). Illicit drugs also flow from the northern border and through the mail from China.
