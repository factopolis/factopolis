  So, the wealthy Americans are not my priority. My priority are the people in the middle class, and hat's where we are giving the big tax reduction to. It's about the middle class, and it's about jobs, and it's about bringing jobs back to the country. Bringing back -- the companies back, so that companies can get a reduction. Right now we're paying the highest tax rate in the world. We want to bring that to around 15%, that would make us competitive with China and other countries.
