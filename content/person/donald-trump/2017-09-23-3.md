  So you need to have a great wall, but it has to be see-through. We are now looking at samples. We have four samples that have already been built, General, right? They've been built... But we are looking at four different samples built by four great companies, four different concepts. They’re just about completed.

    Yes, the government is looking at samples. No, they have not "been built." Nor are they "just about completed." Construction of the prototypes has yet to begin. That’s expected imminently.
