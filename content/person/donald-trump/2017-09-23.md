quote:
  And as soon as we announced -- you know, you look at this arena. You know, the media -- the "fake news", I call it, the worst. Fake news! They won't show this. You know, they'll say, "Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd, very unenthusiastic crowd. It was a terrible evening." No, these are the most -- among the most dishonest people, I really mean it. These are among the most dishonest. For instance, look at the crowd; I'd love to have them show the crowd but they don't show the crowd. They show me. The whole night.
where: rally for Luther Strange
