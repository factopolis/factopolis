    But experts have said the ratings in the first week were likely affected by massive hurricanes that the struck the country. It's also very early in the season and—importantly—if ratings are actually down and stay that way, it's likely more a sign of the changing media landscape rather than fans tuning out because of protests.

    Ratings were down 8 percent in 2016, but experts said the drop was modest and in line with general ratings for the sports industry... As for political motivation, there’s little evidence to suggest people are boycotting the NFL. Most of the professional sports franchises are dealing with declines in popularity.

    In a world where TV viewing is increasingly fragmented and more people are watching on devices or saving programs until later, the majority of TV shows have smaller ratings than the year before. Still, pro football games remain among the most-watched things on television.


    The president may have his theories, but explaining why ratings are down isn’t simple. Maybe the games aren’t as good, with less attractive matchups and blowout scores. Maybe more people are enjoying good late summer weather and are staying outside more this year. Maybe more people are concerned about concussions. Or the games are getting slower with replays.

    Both analysts are skeptical that backlash to players taking a knee during the national anthem is driving the decline, given that the trend began before the former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick's first demonstration during the 2016 season. "I've seen little to no evidence of viewers tuning out due to kneeling or not kneeling," Mr. Karp said.
