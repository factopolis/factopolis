  So we've never seen it. It actually touched down as a Category 5. People have never seen anything like that. And it was dead center. I mean, you couldn't be any more. And don't forget, a week before, it got hit by another hurricane. Now, that one brushed it, but that did tremendous damage too.

    As terrible as it was, Maria actually made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, not 5. Winds were at 155 mph (249 kph), not 157 (253), the minimum for Category 5. It’s a distinction no doubt lost on Puerto Ricans — the storm was even stronger than Harvey and Irma upon landfall, said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. But, "operationally it was a Category 4 hurricane."
  short: As terrible as it was, Maria actually made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, not 5.
