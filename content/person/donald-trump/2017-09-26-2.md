  And Puerto Rico didn't get hit by one hurricane, it got hit by two hurricanes, and they were among the biggest we've ever seen -- with the second one being even worse.  I mean, the second one hit Puerto Rico as a Category 5.  I don't believe anybody has ever seen that happen before -- hit land with that kind of velocity.

    As terrible as it was, Maria actually made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, not 5. Winds were at 155 mph (249 kph), not 157 (253), the minimum for Category 5. It’s a distinction no doubt lost on Puerto Ricans — the storm was even stronger than Harvey and Irma upon landfall, said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. But, "operationally it was a Category 4 hurricane."
  short: As terrible as it was, Maria actually made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, not 5.

    Maria did reach Category 5 status but made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane. Category 4 storms have sustained wind speeds between 130 and 156 miles per hour. Maria hit the upper limit.


    Category 5 landfall wouldn’t have been unprecedented, though, as three such hurricanes have made landfall in the United States, the last one being Hurricane Andrew in Florida 25 years ago.
