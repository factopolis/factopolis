quote:
  America has the highest business tax rate in anywhere in the developed world. We're the highest-taxed nation in the developed world, and I think in the undeveloped world too. But you know, I have to be very accurate with these people because they'll start claiming all sorts of things. So we'll just keep it in the developed world, Mike. Okay?


  But we're the highest-taxed nation in the developed world, and we want to become one of the lowest, and that's what we'll be doing. And we'll be announcing those numbers tomorrow. We want to go over them with the committee, but they are set.


  And the jobs will start pouring in from all over the world coming back to our country. They've left our country, so many of the jobs, and theyâ€™ll be coming back in because we have a non-competitive tax structure right now, and we're going to go super-competitive.
