quote:
   I have a great Cabinet. And, you know, we saved hundreds of millions of dollars through negotiation. I'll give you an example. With the F-35 fighter plane -- me, myself -- I've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in negotiating. And that's one of the reasons I don't like seeing anybody even have a question about, you know, flying. I just don't want to do that.
