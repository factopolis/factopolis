    That's a ridiculously high estimate. Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, according to a credible estimate, and of those, about 80 represented small businesses or farms.

  quote:
    The president’s suggestion that "millions" of small businesses and farms are affected by the estate tax is absurd. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, only about 5,500 estates in 2017 -- out of nearly 3 million estates -- would have to pay any taxes. About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent. That’s because for a married couple, about $11 million is exempt from taxation.


    Only 80 -- that’s right, 80 -- taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.
