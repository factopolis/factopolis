  quote:
    A [study published last year and updated in March by the Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/federal-tax-issues/federal-estate-taxes/) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 38,328 farms would become part of estates in 2016, of which only 0.42 percent — 161 estates — would owe any estate tax at all.


    Separate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center [puts the number even lower](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/briefing-book/briefing_book_-_chapter_4.pdf). TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.

    That assertion appears to be at odds with statistics. Only 1.7 percent of family-farm estates were required to file an estate-tax return in 2016 and only 0.4 percent ended up owing the tax, according to an analysis by the Agriculture Department. Overall, the very rich are affected in particular.
