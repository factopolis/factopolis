  quote:
    A [study published last year and updated in March by the Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/federal-tax-issues/federal-estate-taxes/) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 38,328 farms would become part of estates in 2016, of which only 0.42 percent — 161 estates — would owe any estate tax at all.


    Separate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center [puts the number even lower](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/briefing-book/briefing_book_-_chapter_4.pdf). TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.
