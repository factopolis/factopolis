  quote:
    Of course, he has not released his tax returns, so it is difficult to know for sure. But he is certainly subject to the AMT -- and the one recent tax return that has been leaked, from 2005, shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $5.3 million to $36.5 million. So at least in that tax year, he potentially could have saved $31 million.


    Eliminating the estate tax, meanwhile, is likely to benefit his heirs.
