  quote:
    Of course, he has not released his tax returns, so it is difficult to know for sure. But he is certainly subject to the AMT -- and the one recent tax return that has been leaked, from 2005, shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $5.3 million to $36.5 million. So at least in that tax year, he potentially could have saved $31 million.


    Eliminating the estate tax, meanwhile, is likely to benefit his heirs.

    Of course, [Trump was the first major-party presidential candidate since 1976 not to release his tax returns](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/28/tammy-baldwin/donald-trump-only-major-party-nominee-40-years-not/), so it's hard to say exactly how he'll be affected. But based on [tax returns which have become public](http://time.com/4517197/donald-trump-defends-leaked-tax-returns-pueblo/) and what we know of his finances, there are at least three key ways he could benefit.
