  quote:
    Trump's refusal to release his tax returns makes it impossible to quantify exactly how much he would personally benefit from his policy proposals. But what is known about Trump's past patterns of taxation and his income and wealth holdings strongly suggest that at least three proposed changes -- to the alternative minimum tax, to the tax on "passthrough" income, and to the estate tax -- would benefit Trump or his family either immediately or down the road.
