    Despite Trump's claim, a poll released Monday – a day before the runoff election – showed that the president's endorsement [had little effect on the race](http://TheHill.com/homenews/campaign/352277-moore-leading-strange-by-11-points-in-poll-released-on-eve-of-election) between Strange and Moore.

    Trump can point to one poll that showed Strange narrowing Moore's lead by four points after his rally. But other polling data doesn't back this up, and his tweet glosses over the fact that he had announced his endorsement weeks earlier and that the increase in that one poll is so modest as to be within the margin of error.
