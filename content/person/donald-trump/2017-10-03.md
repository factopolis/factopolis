  So Brock has been unbelievable. And this has been the toughest one. This has been a Category 5, which few people have ever even heard of -- a Category 5 hitting land. But it hit land -- and, boy, did it hit land.

    As terrible as it was, Maria actually made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, not 5. Winds were at 155 mph (249 kph), not 157 (253), the minimum for Category 5. It’s a distinction no doubt lost on Puerto Ricans — the storm was even stronger than Harvey and Irma upon landfall, said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. But, "operationally it was a Category 4 hurricane."
  short: As terrible as it was, Maria actually made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, not 5.
