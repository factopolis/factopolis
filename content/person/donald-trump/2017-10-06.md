  This tax cut and tax reform is going very well, and it's going to be a tremendous boost for our country, including the fact that we're the highest-taxed nation in the world. And we will go from that to being down on the lower wrung of taxes. So we'll be paying far, far less. So that's very important for keeping our businesses and our jobs.
