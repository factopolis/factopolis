  I want to give the middle income people in this country -- and this is not a tax [cut] for the rich. Now, everybody's gonna benefit. But this is what we're focused on more than anything and even more so, we're actually adding things in as we speak, because you know, the plan's being adjusted, et cetera. But this is for the middle class.

    A majority of the top quintile (taxpayers earning $154,900 and above in 2027) would see their taxes increase, according to the TPC table above, which shows 53.4 percent of the top quintile with an average tax increase of $4,400. But 46.4 percent in that group see an average tax cut of $27,910.


    For the highest earners — those in the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent — nearly all would see lower taxes. Ninety percent of the top 1 percent — those earning about $900,000 and above in 2027 — would get a tax cut, averaging $234,050.
