    Far from being set up, Mr. Corker asked that I tape our conversation.


    "I know theyâ€™re recording it, and I hope you are, too," he said as two of his aides listened in on other lines, one of them also taping the interview.

    A transcript of the conversation, however, shows that the newspaper did not set Corker up and that the senator was well aware that he was on the record.
