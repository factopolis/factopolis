    Trump clearly admitted that he was just throwing it out there that President Obama didn't call the families of those killed serving their country. Like at his rallies, he was testing a line to see if it would stick. It didn't because it was challenged, so he backtracked.

    Mr. Trump's assertion belied a long record of meetings Mr. Obama held with the families of killed service people, as well as calls and letters.

    A former White House official also told CBS News, "President Trump's claim is wrong. President Obama engaged families of the fallen and wounded warriors throughout his presidency through calls, letters, visits to Section 60 at Arlington, visits to Walter Reed, visits to Dover, and regular meetings with Gold Star Families at the White House and across the country."

    The record is plain that presidents reached out to families of the dead and to the wounded, often with their presence as well as by letter and phone.

    Given that Trump more or less took back his claim in real time, we will not rate this statement. But Trump, as is his style, was too quick to charge that Obama had not made phone calls.
