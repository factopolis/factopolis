quote:
  "So we have $3.5 trillion coming back that will just -- literally you couldn't get it back, because of the tax system. It didn't really allow the companies even -- it didn't make sense to bring it back. The number was so high, and the bureaucracy so great. So all of that money -- it could be more than $3.5 trillion. You know, for years we've all been saying $2.5 trillion, well let me tell you: it's grown a lot, and it's at least $3.5 trillion will come back into our country and be put to work on jobs and other things."
