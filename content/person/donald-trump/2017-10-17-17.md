    Trump takes credit for West Virginia's economic gains, but it's undeserved. For one, when the first quarter ended on March 31, 2017, Trump was just two months into his presidency. While he was quick to do away with several regulations on energy production, many of the new policies have yet to take effect. The state's recent growth is due to increased mining production and a rise in prices for coal and natural gas.
