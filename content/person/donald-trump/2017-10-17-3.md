  While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray -- and I do commend it -- I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.

    “Bailout” typically refers to financial assistance offered to prevent the bankruptcy of a company or industry... The funds Mr. Trump now refers to, on the other hand, are more accurately characterized as a reimbursement that the government pays to the insurance companies. It is done not to save the companies from financial ruin -- unlike the banks in 2008, they are not in danger of failing -- but to cover the cost of cheaper health care for low- and moderate-income Americans.
