quote:
  "Finally, we are going to bring back trillions of dollars currently parked overseas. You look at the money that can't come back into our country -- I've been saying for years it's $2.5 trillion. Democrats want it back, Republicans want it back, and they have for a long time, they've never been able to make a deal. Lack of leadership. They've never been able to make a deal.


  We're putting that in oun tax plan we're going to bring -- I think it's going to be over $3 trillion. It could be substantially more than that because if I'm saying $2.5 trillion and I've been saying it for many years, we know one thing: it's a lot more now. Nobody really knows the answer; I will tell you I think it's very substantially over $3 trillion that will be brought back in our plan and put to work in our country, not some other country."
