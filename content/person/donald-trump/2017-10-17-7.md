  Because a lot of people know exactly what I'm talking about, and in many cases they think I'm right when I say "the highest". As far as I'm concerned, I think we're really essentially the highest, but if you'd like to add "the developed nation" you can say that, too. But a lot of people agree that the way that I'm saying it is exactly correct.

    The president's slight modification of his claim simply further demonstrates how seriously wrong he continues to be on this issue. Among its economic peers, the United States is not at all the highest-taxed nation, no matter how you crunch the numbers. Trump may have convinced himself that heâ€™s right, but he continues to be very, very wrong.

    Looking at tax collections relative to the size of the U.S. economy and the number of people, the numbers tell a different story. The United States ranks 28th in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP and 13th on a per-capita basis.
