quote:
  Well, we're the highest taxed nation in the world. Our companies are leaving -- although I've stopped the flow to a large extent. Our companies are leaving because our taxes are so high, so they're going to other countries where they pay much lower taxes. They're firing our workers; everybody is fired. They open up, and then they build product, then they sell it right back into our country.
