    As we said, the GOP tax framework is still missing some details. The final tax bill hasn’t yet been written, although it [may be released](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-republicans-delay-tax-plan-rollout/story?id=50849898) as early as Nov. 2. But the Trump administration’s claim of the "largest" tax cut in history remains unsupported, and disputed by budget experts.
