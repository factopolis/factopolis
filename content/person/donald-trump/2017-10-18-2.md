  They got hit by a Category 4 -- grazed -- but grazed about a big portion of the island, but it was grazed. The rest of it hit Florida, as you know. But that was bad. But then they got hit dead-center -- if you look at those maps -- by a Category 5. Nobody has ever heard of a five hitting land. Usually by that time it’s dissipated. It hit right through -- and kept to a five -- it hit right through the middle of the island, right through the middle of Puerto Rico. There’s never been anything like that.

    That account is wrong. Maria made landfall on Puerto as a Category 4 storm at 6:35 a.m. Wednesday, Sept. 20, with winds of 155 mph (249 kph), just short of the 157 mph (253 kph) of a 5. Nor did it rake across the island as a Category 5. It weakened, and left the island some seven hours later as barely a Category 3.
