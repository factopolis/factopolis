quote:
  It's also going to bring back -- if we get this passed, which I really believe we will -- I think we have to, as a country -- it's going to bring back, I would say, $4 trillion back into this country, which right now cannot come back. It's being spent in other countries. Money that wants to come back into the United States cannot come back, but under our plan, that money will flow back in. It will be very quick, and it will be very easy. And it's a lot of money.


  Nobody even knows the amount. It was $2.5 trillion a few years ago, so I would say now it's got to be close to $4 trillion or maybe above that number. We'll find out soon because it's going to come back very, very rapidly.
