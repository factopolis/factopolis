    Several experts cast doubt on the wall's potential effect. They noted that much of the illegal drugs coming into the United States arrive through legal ports of entry and that smugglers also use other tools that a wall wouldn't stop (even catapults). Illicit drugs also flow from the northern border and through the mail from China.
