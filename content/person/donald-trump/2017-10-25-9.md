quote:
  And I say to my people, you tell them, like as an example, we lose all the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO -- within the WTO, because we have fewer judges than other countries. It's set-up; you can't win. In other words, the panels are set up so that we don't have majorities.

    In March, Dan Ikenson, director of Cato's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, [reviewed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2017/03/09/u-s-trade-laws-and-the-sovereignty-canard/#7ab53f7c203f) WTO trade disputes involving the U.S. from 1995 to March of this year. He found that the U.S. prevailed in 91 percent of cases that it brought against other countries.


    "When the United States has been a complainant (as it has in 114 of 522 WTO disputes over 22 years — more than any other WTO member) it has prevailed on 91 percent of adjudicated issues," he wrote. "When the United States is a respondent (as it has been in 129 cases — more than any other WTO member), it has lost on 89 percent of adjudicated issues."

    It's true, as Trump says, that the "panels are set up so that we don't have majorities." But neither does the opposing country. In fact, none of the panelists come from countries involved in a dispute. That's not evidence, as Trump says, that the dispute resolution system is "set up for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States."
