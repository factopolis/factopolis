    Trump himself praised Papadopoulos [to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/21/a-transcript-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/).


    Additionally, Papadopoulos was known within the campaign because, [as the court document states](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4163374-Manafort-Gates-Indictment-Special-Counsel.html), he regularly emailed a campaign supervisor and his messages were discussed between other campaign officials, which CNN has now identified, according to a congressional source, as Manafort and Gates.

    What we do know is that during this time -- from late March to mid-August -- Papadopoulos was in regular contact with senior Trump campaign officials and attended a national security meeting with Trump. We will let readers decide if this constitutes a "low-level volunteer."

    Papadopoulos did literally have a seat at the table, however, at a foreign policy staff meeting with Trump, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions and others, a photo of which Trump shared on Twitter.
