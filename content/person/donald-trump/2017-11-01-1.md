    The bill was signed by a Republican president, and the final version of the legislation received majority Republican support in both chambers of Congress, In fact, McConnell and several other Republicans still in office voted for the bill. Moreover, Trump’s tweet ignores that Schumer, just four years ago, worked to pass a bill that would have ended the lottery, but it died due to Republican opposition in the House.

    Schumer, then in the House, now a senator, did back the lottery program. It had bipartisan support in an era when legal immigration was less contentious. He also proposed eliminating it three years ago, colleagues say.

    The bill -- which had 32 co-sponsors, including Schumer and seven Republicans -- passed the House [231-192](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1990/roll406.xml) with a majority of Democrats voting for it, and a majority of Republicans against it.

    So it can rightly be said that Schumer had a hand in creating the diversity visa program. But it’s also the case that Schumer was part of the bipartisan Gang of Eight that in 2013 proposed a sweeping immigration overhaul that would have repealed the diversity visa program ([see Sec. 2303](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/744)).
