quote:
  You know, for years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan. And the problem was they talked about tax reform, not tax cuts. I said, don't call it "reform," call it "tax cuts and reform." So every once in a while we'll add the name "reform." But it's tax cuts.

    Trump's statement is ridiculously wrong -- since 1997, nine major tax bills have passed with tens of billions of dollars in cuts.
