  quote:
    Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other two inked such a pledge earlier in their careers. Trump wasnâ€™t one of them, but Clinton specifically mentioned the primary field. And that makes the claim both inaccurate and ridiculous.
