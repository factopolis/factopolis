  So I was very proud of the policies we put forth. You know, I kept waiting for the moment -- I, you know, I've watched a million presidential debates in my life and I was waiting for the moment when one of the people asking the questions would have said, well, so exactly how are you going to create more jobs, right? ... I thought at some moment that would happen.

    But it did happen. Twice. Both Holt and Wallace devoted an extensive part of their debates to job creation and the economy. Trump told both moderators that he would create jobs by renegotiating trade deals, cutting regulations, reducing business taxes, and repatriating corporate cash held overseas.
