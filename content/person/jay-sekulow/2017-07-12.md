  The president didn't sign off on anythingâ€¦ the statement that was

  in consultation with his lawyers. The president wasn't involved in

    But these statements are about as contradictory as it gets, when compared to The Post's new report. What's remarkable is that, as Stephanopoulos noted, the New York Times had reported at the time, on [July 11](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/russia-trump.html?_r=1), that the president himself approved the statement.
