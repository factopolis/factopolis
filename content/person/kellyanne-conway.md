           He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this
           country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to
           get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come
           back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling
           Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away.

          I bet, there was very little coverage — I bet it's brand new
          information to people that President Obama had a six-month
          ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here
          to this country, were radicalized — and they were the
          masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. I mean, most
          people don't know that because it didn't get covered.

          I was told yesterday, that this is longest that the nation

          it.
