quote:
  "Well first of all, think about this: you need to look at the tax plan and the totality of the entire, of not just one simple deduction. Look it at overall, at what it does. And then think of this: is it fair that other states subsidize states that have high state taxes? Because look at California. California is one of the most mis-managed, high-taxed state in the nation, and they use an argument inside that capitol that \"Let's raise taxes, because you can write it off on your federal income tax.\" Well that's not fair for all of America. It would actually encourage states to manage their states better. So I think it's fair, and when you look at the entire total tax bill, you'll know at the end of the day: it's fair, it's more competitive, and in the process it's simpler for everyone."
