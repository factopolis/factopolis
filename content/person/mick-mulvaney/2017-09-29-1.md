quote:
  Look, if you and I make the same amount of money, we live in the same value house, we drive the same value car, our kids go to the same schools, should we pay the exact same to help support the federal goverment? Shouldn't our tax burden be exactly the same? And the answer is yes, but that's not the way the world works right now. If you live in a low-tax state you actually pay higher taxes to the federal goverment than the exact same person does in California or New York and that's just not fair.
