    Trump himself [blew all of that up a day later](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/11/president-trump-just-decimated-the-white-houses-entire-comey-narrative/), telling NBC News's Lester Holt that he had already decided to fire Comey and would have done it regardless of the DOJ's recommendation. Trump also said clearly that the Russia probe was on his mind. “When I decided to [fire Comey], I said to myself, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,” he said.

    The White House also initially said it was Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton investigation — not Russia — as the reason behind the firing. But in the interview with Holt, Trump mentioned Russia as a rationale.
