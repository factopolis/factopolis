        quote:
          It is quite remarkable. In fact, since you are asking more
          about it, it is a masterful work on the part of President
          Obama to bring the P-5, Russia, China, into the fold. They
          have never voted with us in the U.N. on any sanctions on
          Iran in the past. So from a diplomatic standpoint to get us
          to this place was masterful.
