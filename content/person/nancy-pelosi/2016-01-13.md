  It is quite remarkable. In fact, since you are asking more about it,
  it is a masterful work on the part of President Obama to bring the
  P-5, Russia, China, into the fold. They have never voted with us in
  the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past. So from a diplomatic
  standpoint to get us to this place was masterful.
