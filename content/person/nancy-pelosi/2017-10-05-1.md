  The tax cuts in the bill -- 80 percent of the tax cuts in the bill benefit the top 1 percent in our country. $2.6 trillion in tax cuts go to corporate America. Around $475 million -- excuse me, $475 billion in tax increases go to Middle America. ... So, again, it raises taxes on middle class, cuts the tax of the wealthiest, adds trillions to the deficit.
