  Because let's look at the person that actually started the rally. Itâ€™s come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street that was an Obama sympathizer. So, wait a minute, be careful where you start taking these people to.


  And look at the background. You know, you know George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals. Who is he? I think he's from Hungary. I think he was Jewish. And I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis. Better be careful where we go with those.

    But Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) still seems swayed by the "false flag" theory of the white supremacist violence.
