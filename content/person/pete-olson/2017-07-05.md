  I guarantee you, they had the conversation where he basically said,
  "Mrs. Lynch, call your attack dog off. We’ve killed people. We killed
  Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you." And
  then what happens to things? All of a sudden — well, she did it,
  yeah, it was all terrible, don’t know who got the information, very
  classified. But no indictment.

    There’s no evidence of Clinton saying as much nor a factual basis for anyone to say the Clintons killed Foster. This claim, which Olson backed off after it became widely known, adds up to a baseless accusation.
