quote:
  The president early on called on NATO member countries to step up their contributions, step of their commitment to NATO, modernize their own forces. And he got a lot of blow-back from that, concerns that we were going to leave NATO, that we were not committed to Article 5. He's been very clear, and as a result of that countries have stepped up contributions toward their own defense.

    According to NATO, over the last 3 years, European allies and Canada spent almost $46 billion more on defense, meaning increases in spending have occurred before Trump’s presidency. Experts said it’s possible that Trump’s pressure has contributed to the continuation of the upward trend, but Tillerson’s explanation glazes over the other factors that have led to increases, including the conflict in the Ukraine in 2014.
