    We found one example — when Trump said, "If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?" — that clearly fits the criteria of promoting or encouraging violence.


    This was not an isolated incident; we found at least seven other examples in which Trump offered public musings that showed a tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition toward, physical violence.

    This is laughable.


    Even if you don't believe Trump has technically incited violence (which he has been sued for), he clearly nodded toward violence at his campaign rallies. Sometimes it was veiled; other times it was unmistakable. Sometimes he was talking about self-defense, but it was clear he was advocating for a “form of violence.”
