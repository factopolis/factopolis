  quote:
    "[According to preliminary data from Nielsen](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-inauguration-ratings-20170119-story.html), 30.6 million viewers across 12 networks watched Trump’s inauguration. Two inaugurations beat Trump’s TV viewership: Obama in 2009 (37.8 million) and Ronald Reagan in 1981 (41.8 million).


    Spicer noted that CNN.com drew [16.9 million](http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/21/trump-inauguration-ratings/) livestreams. Combined with TV viewings, that would boost Trump to an audience of at least 47.5 million.


    In 2009, however, CNN.com provided [nearly 27 million streams](http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/01/21/inauguration.online.video/) for Obama’s inauguration, giving a viewership of at least 59.1 million. That’s still 17.3 million more than Trump’s."

  quote:
    This is an appalling performance by the new press secretary. He managed to make a series of false and misleading claims in service of a relatively minor issue. Presumably he was ordered to do this by Trump, who conjured up fantastic numbers in his own mind, but part of a flack’s job is to tell the boss when lies are necessary — and when they are not.


    Spicer earns Four Pinocchios, but seriously, we wish we could give five.
