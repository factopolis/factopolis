quote:
  Well Maria, as you know, I've lived in New York and California; two of the highest taxed states, so for me this would be a very bad thing, but the right thing for the American People. I think we should get the federal government out of the business of subsidizing states. The federal government has no business subsidizing states from standpoint. This should be fair in that we treat all the states the same way.
