quote:
  Do you know the United States has the highest corporate tax rate of any developed country in the world? You look at countries all over Europe; Ireland, you look at The United Kingdom, you look at France. They're cutting their tax rate, and what's happening is jobs are fleeing to those countries. Capital goes where it gets the right tax rate.
