  quote:
    The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldn't have showed up as having lied because of the Air Force's failure to report his felony.


    The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didn't help, Cruz's clarifications becoming law may have. But it's impossible to say with any certainty.
