quote:
  Well, if you don't pay income taxes and we increase your refund by 40 percent, that is a direct dollar impact. In other words, you'll have more money to use to keep those ends together, those single mothers like mine, who are working paycheck to paycheck, they will now not get a $9,300 deduction, we're doubling that deduction almost to $18,000, For a dual-parent income household we're going from around $12,700 for the standard deduction to around $24,000.

  quote: Scott's logic rests on Americans who do not pay income taxes no longer having to pay the penalty for not carrying health insuranceâ€¦ That's more of a gamble than anything close to a certainty.
