  Our [#TaxReform](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaxReform?src=hash) framework turns the page on a complicated & broken tax system. It's simpler, flatter & fairer than the current tax code. It will put more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans. It also promotes economic growth & private-sector job creation by slashing
  the corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – and ensuring fair treatment for small businesses. Congress needs to get the final product to the president's desk as quickly as possible.
