      Under Obama, 161 detainees were transferred from Guantanamo Bay
      and only 9 have been confirmed to have reengaged and returned to
      the battlefield.
    quote:
      A bulk of those detainees that returned to the battlefield,
      however, were released under the Bush administration, before the
      U.S. set up an interagency screening and hearing process for
      each prisoner. The report says that of the 532 detainees
      released from the detention facility under Bush, 113 returned to
      the battlefield, or about 21 percent.

      Under Obama, 161 detainees were transferred from Guantanamo Bay
      and only 9 have been confirmed to have reengaged and returned to
      the battlefield. That’s just under 6 percent of the total
      transferred since 2009.

      According to the government’s latest “Summary of Reengagement of
      Detainees Formerly Held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,” the vast
      majority of the released Gitmo detainees who were “confirmed of
      reengaging” — 113 of the 122 — were released or transferred out
      of Gitmo by President Bush.
