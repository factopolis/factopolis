      About 20 million have gained insurance under the act. The
      uninsured rate fell to 10.9 percent at the end of last year,
      according to Gallup, compared with 17.1 percent at the end of
      2013. Analysis from the Commonwealth Fund concluded that the
      Affordable Care Act was responsible for a majority of the
      decline.
