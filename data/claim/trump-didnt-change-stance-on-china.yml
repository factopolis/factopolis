    quote:
      As a candidate, Trump pitched himself as the antidote to what he
      said had become a one-sided relationship with China. He promised
      to label China a currency manipulator on Day One, something he
      has now said he has no immediate plans to do, and to make more
      even the trade relationship between the two nations.

      In the interview that aired Tuesday, Trump left open the
      possibility that China might ultimately be unable, or unwilling,
      to apply sufficient pressure on North Korea.
